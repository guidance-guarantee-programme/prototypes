  Deciding how you want your pension to be paid
<% end %>

<p>Your pension pot is all the money you paid into a private or workplace pension.
  You can decide how you want this money paid to you.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take part of your pension pot as cash (lump sum)</li>
  <li>keep your pot invested while taking money from it (drawdown)</li>
  <li>buy a regular income (annuity)</li>
</ul>


<p>You can use a mixture of all 3 if you want.</p>

<h2>You want a larger sum straight away</h2>

<p>You can take 25% of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum.
  If you take more you’ll pay tax on it.</p>

<p>You have to be at least 55 to do this.</p>

<p>While this might sound like a good option you should think carefully how
  you’ll use the money and if you’ll have enough left to pay for the coming years
  of your retirement.</p>

<p>The tax are different for pots of £30,000 or less.</p>

<h3>Taking your whole pension pot as tax-free cash</h3>

<p>You can do this if you have £30,000 or less in your entire pot.</p>

<p>You can also take up to 3 individual pots of £10,000 or less. In this case
  it doesn’t matter how much your entire pot is.</p>

<p>You must be at least 60 for this option.</p>

<p>If you decide to do this you should think about how you’ll use the money to
  pay for your retirement.</p>

<h2>You want flexibility</h2>

<p>You can leave your pension pot invested after you retire and just take out
  what and when you need it. This is called 'income drawdown'.  Like with all
  investments the value of your pot can go up or down.</p>

<p>There are 2 types of drawdown - capped and flexible.</p>

<p>With capped drawdown your pension provider calculates the maximum amount you
  can take out every year. This is so that you won’t run out of money.</p>

<p>With flexible drawdown you can take out as much as you want. You can also
  take the whole pot any time you want.</p>

<p>To get flexible drawdown you must prove to your pension provider that you
  already have a minimum pension income of at least £12,000 a year, eg from an
  annuity.</p>

<p>Any money you take from your pension as drawdown is taxed.</p>

<h2>You want security</h2>

<p>If you prefer to have a regular income you can use your pension pot to buy
  one. This is called an annuity. It’s a contract between you and an insurance
  company. You hand your pension pot over to them and they guarantee you regular
  payments until you die.</p>

<p>To calculate an annuity insurance companies take into account things like the
  size of your pot, your age and sometimes your health.</p>

<p>You can also buy an annuity that’s just for a fixed number of years instead of
  the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Once you’ve bought an annuity you can’t change it and usually you can’t pass
  it on to anyone after you die.</p>

<p>You pay tax on your annuity payments, just like you did on your salary.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p><strong>Example: mixing your options</strong></p>

  <p>Your pension pot is £60,000. You decide to take 25% as tax-free cash = £15,000.</p>

  <p>You then use £20,000 to buy an annuity which would give you a yearly income between £800 and £900, depending on the insurer.</p>

  <p>You leave £25,000 invested and take out £XXX per year.</p>
