      <p>You can decide how to take the money from your pension pot when you retire.
        It doesn’t matter if your pot comes from a private pension that you set up yourself,
        a workplace pension you paid into, or both.</p>

      <p>To decide how you want your pension to be paid you should think about the following:</p>

      <ol class="steps">
        <li>How much do I have in my pot?</li>
        <li>How much will I need in retirement?</li>
        <li>How can I best use my money?</li>
      </ol>


      <p>There are different ways you can take the money from your pension pot.</p>

      <p>You can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>take part of your pension pot as cash (lump sum)</li>
        <li>keep your pot invested while taking money from it (drawdown)</li>
        <li>buy a regular income (annuity)</li>
      </ul>


      <p>You can use a mixture of all 3 if you want.</p>

      <h2>Taking cash</h2>

      <p>You can take 25% of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum. You have to be at least 55 to do this.</p>

      <p>All other income you get from your pension pot is taxed.</p>

      <p>Before you take a lump sum you should think about what you’ll use the cash for and make sure you’ll have enough money for the coming years of your retirement.</p>

      <p>If you take your whole pension pot as cash you’re likely to pay higher tax on it unless it’s a pot of £30,000 or less</p>

      <h3>Taking your whole pension pot as tax-free cash</h3>

      <p>You can do this if you have £30,000 or less in your entire pot.</p>

      <p>You can also take up to 3 individual pots of £10,000 or less. In this case it doesn’t matter how much your entire pot is.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 60 for this option.</p>

      <p>If you decide to do this you should think about how you’ll use the money to pay for your retirement.</p>

      <h2>Taking money out when you need it</h2>

      <p>You can leave your pension pot invested and take money out when you need it. This is called ‘income drawdown’ and it’s a bit like a bank account. Your pension provider will invest the pot, for example in stocks and shares, and you tell them when you need money and how much.</p>

      <p>There are 2 types of drawdown - capped and flexible.</p>

      <p>With capped drawdown your pension provider calculates the maximum amount you can take out every year. This is so that you won’t run out of money.</p>

      <p>With flexible drawdown you can take out as much as you want. You can also take the whole pot any time you want.</p>

      <p>To get flexible drawdown you must prove to your pension provider that you already have a minimum pension income of at least £12,000 a year, eg from an annuity.</p>

      <p>Any money you take from your pension as drawdown is taxed.</p>

      <h2>Buying a regular income</h2>

      <p>You can use your pension pot to buy a regular income for the rest of your life. This is called an annuity. You buy it from an insurance company like, for example, a life insurance.</p>

      <p>You hand over your pension pot to them and they guarantee you a regular income until you die, even if your pension pot runs out of money.</p>

      <p>Once you've bought your annuity your can't change this decision.</p>

      <p>How much money you get from your annuity depends on things like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>how much you have in your pension pot</li>
        <li>your age and gender</li>
        <li>interest rates</li>
        <li>sometimes your health and lifestyle</li>
      </ul>


      <p>You <a href="#insert_url">pay tax on payments from your annuity</a>, just like you do on your salary.</p>

      <p>You can also buy an annuity that’s just for a fixed amount of years.</p>

      <p>Usually you can’t pass it on to anyone after you die unless you have a special set up with your pension provider.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example: mixing your options</strong></p>

        <p>You could mix these options at different points in your retirement.</p>

        <p>Your pension pot is £60,000. You decide to take 25% as tax-free cash = £15,000.</p>

        <p>You then use £20,000 to buy an annuity which will give you an income of £XXX.</p>

        <p>You leave £25,000 invested and take out £XXX per year.</p>
