          <h2 id="options-you-have">Options you have</h2>
          <p>
            You can decide how to take the money from your pension pot when you
            retire. It doesn’t matter if your pot comes from a private pension
            that you set up yourself, a workplace pension you paid into, or both.
          </p>

          <p>Your pension must be a defined contribution pension. This means it’s
            based on how much you paid into your pot, not your salary near retirement. </p>

          <p>
            You can usually take 25% of your pension pot tax free.
          </p>

          <p>The remaining 75% you can take as:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>cash</li>
            <li>an <span class="tooltip" title="Gives you a regular income in your retirement">annuity</span> - you buy an insurance policy that gives you an income for the rest of your life</li>
            <li><span class="tooltip" title="Your pension pot stays invested and you take money out when you need it">income drawdown</span> - your pot stays invested while you take money from it</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You can mix these 3 options if you want.</p>

          <div class="application-notice info-notice">
            <p>
              You can also choose to do nothing and leave your pension pot
              untouched until you need the money.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="do-nothing">Do nothing</h2>
          <p>When you reach retirement age or decide to retire you don’t automatically have to start taking money from your pension pot. You can leave the money invested and continue to pay into your pot, eg if you continue to work. This means your pension pot could grow further.</p>

          <p>Leaving your pension pot may give you a larger amount of money to last for a shorter amount of time. It will also give you more time to think about your pension options and how best you can use the money in the future.</p>

          <p>Whatever money you leave in your fund you can pass on tax free after you die.</p>

          <p>Usually the earliest you can start taking money from your pot is at the age of 55.</p>

          <h2 id="take-25-tax-free">Take 25% tax free</h2>

          <p>There are 2 ways you can take tax-free lump sums.</p>

          <h3>Take your lump sum in one go</h3>

          <p>
            You can take 25% of your whole pension pot tax-free.
            After that you have to <a href="/tax-you-pay-on-your-pension">pay Income Tax</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, your pot is £60,000 and you take £15,000 tax-free in one go.
            Any payments you get from the remaining £45,000 would be taxed.
          </p>

          <p>
            What you do with the remaining money is up to you. You can, for example,
            <a href="#get-a-guaranteed-income-annuity">buy an annuity</a> or set up <a href="#take-money-out-when-you-need-it-income-drawdown">income drawdown</a>
            where you take money out as you need it. For both of these you would have to
            move the money from your current pension fund into a new one that offers these options.
          </p>

          <h3>Take smaller sums</h3>

          <p>
            You can take smaller cash sums from your pension pot - 25% of each sum would be tax-free.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, your pot is £60,000 and you take £1,000 out as cash every month.
            £250 of this amount would be tax-free every time. The remaining £750 would be taxed.
          </p>

          <p>
            With this option you would leave your money in your existing pension fund and
            only take cash payments from it. You could also still pay into your existing fund.
            This option is a bit like a savings account.
          </p>

          <p>Like with every investment there is the risk that your fund can go up or down, depending on the market. </p>

          <p>
            You’ll have to pay charges to your pension provider to run the fund for you.
          </p>

          <h2 id="take-your-whole-pot-as-cash">Take your whole pot as cash</h2>
          <p>
            You can take your whole pension pot as cash.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can take 25% <a href="#take-25-tax-free">tax free</a>.
            You'll <a href="/tax-you-pay-on-your-pension">pay Income Tax</a> on the remaining 75%.
          </p>

          <p>
            You also have the option to take part of your pot as a
            <a href="/tax-you-pay-on-your-pension#whats-tax-free">tax-free lump sum</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the remaining amount you’ll <a href="/tax-you-pay-on-your-pension">pay Income Tax</a>.
          </p>

          <div class="application-notice help-notice">
            <p>Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot can bump you into a higher tax rate.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            You can also take smaller cash sums from your pot over time - 25% of each sum would be
            <a href="/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#take-25-tax-free">tax free</a>.
          </p>

          <h2 id="take-money-out-when-you-need-it-income-drawdown">Take money out when you need it (income drawdown)</h2>
          <p>
            You can move your pension pot into one or more funds that allow you to take money out when you need it.
            This is called '<span class="tooltip" title="Your pension pot stays invested and you take money out when you need it">income drawdown</span>'.
            Ask your pension provider how to do this.
          </p>

          <p>
            The money will be re-invested and could still grow. This depends on how
            well your investments do. Like with every investment there is the
            risk that your fund can go up or down, depending on the market.
          </p>

          <p>
            After it's re-invested, you tell your provider when you need money and how much. They’ll pay it into
            your bank account after any <a href="/tax-you-pay-on-your-pension">Income Tax</a> is taken off.
          </p>

          <p>
            With <span class="tooltip" title="Your pension pot stays invested and you take money out when you need it">income drawdown</span> you can’t pay any more money into your pot.
            You’ll also pay charges to your provider to run the <span class="tooltip" title="Your pension pot stays invested and you take money out when you need it">income drawdown</span> fund for you.
          </p>

          <h2 id="get-a-guaranteed-income-annuity">Get a guaranteed income (annuity)</h2>
          <p>
            You can use your pension pot to buy a guaranteed income for the rest of your life.
            This is called an <span class="tooltip" title="Gives you a regular income in your retirement">annuity</span>. It guarantees you a regular income until you die, even
            if your pension pot runs out of money.
          </p>

          <p>
            You hand over your pension pot to an insurance company and they pay you a retirement
            income in return. Once you’ve bought your annuity you can’t change this decision.
          </p>

          <div class="application-notice info-notice">
            <p>You don’t have to use your whole pension pot to buy an annuity. You can mix your options.</p>
          </div>

          <p>How much money you get depends on things like:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>how much you have in your pension pot</li>
            <li>your age and gender</li>
            <li>interest rates</li>
            <li>your health and lifestyle</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You <a href="/tax-you-pay-on-your-pension">pay tax on payments from an annuity</a>,
            just like you do on your salary. You’ll also pay administration charges to
            your annuity provider.
          </p>

          <p>You can also buy an annuity that’s only for a fixed amount of years.</p>

          <p>
            If you want to pass your <span class="tooltip" title="Gives you a regular income in your retirement">annuity</span> payments on to your spouse or partner
            you’ll have to buy a joint annuity. This means that payments during your
            lifetime will be lower.
          </p>

          <h2 id="mix-your-pension-options">Mix your pension options</h2>
          <p>
            You can mix your pension options. You can do this at different times in your retirement.
            For example, you can take some cash from your pot first and buy an <span class="tooltip" title="Gives you a regular income in your retirement">annuity</span> later.
          </p>

          <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example: mixing your options</strong></p>
            <p>You could mix these options at different points in your retirement.</p>

            <p>Your pension pot is £60,000. You decide to take 25% as tax-free cash = £15,000.</p>

            <p>You then use £20,000 to buy an annuity. This will give you an income for the rest of your life of about £900 a year.</p>

            <p>You then leave the remaining £25,000 invested and take out £5,000 a year for about 5 years.</p>
