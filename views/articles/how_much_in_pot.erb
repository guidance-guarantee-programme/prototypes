            <p>If you’re unsure how much you’ve got in your pension pot or how many pots you’ve paid into, there are different ways to find out.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="check-value-of-your-pension-pot">Check value of your pension pot</h2>

          <p>You can:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>phone your pension provider (the pension scheme you paid into)</li>
            <li>look at your pension statement - your provider should have sent you these once a year</li>
            <li>look at your ‘wake-up pack’ - this is the pack you got from your pension provider between 6 and 4 months before your agreed retirement age (usually between 55 and 65)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you’re less than 4 months away from your retirement age and haven’t got a wake-up pack you should contact your pension provider.</p>

          <p>You might have paid into more than one pension pot during your working life. To find out the value of your entire pension pot you need to contact each provider.</p>
