      <p>You can use your pension pot to buy a regular income for the rest of your life. This is called an annuity. You buy it from an insurance company, for example like you would buy life insurance.</p>

      <p>You hand over your pension pot to them and they guarantee you a regular income until you die, even if your pension pot runs out of money.</p>

      <p>Once you've bought your annuity your can't change this decision.</p>

      <p>How much money you get depends on things like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>how much you have in your pension pot</li>
        <li>your age and gender</li>
        <li>interest rates</li>
        <li>your health and lifestyle</li>
      </ul>


      <p>You <a href="#insert_url">pay tax on payments from your annuity</a>, just like you do on your salary.</p>

      <p>You can also buy an annuity thatâ€™s only for a fixed amount of years.</p>

      <p>If you want to pass your annuity payments on to your spouse or partner you'll have to buy a joint annuity. This means that payments during your lifetime will be lower.</p>
