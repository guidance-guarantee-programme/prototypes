          <p>Contact your pension provider first if you need to complain. Most people get things resolved this way. As every pension is different, your pension provider will usually be best placed to give you the right answer as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>Contact the Pension Service if you have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/complain-pension-service">complaint about the State Pension.</a></p>

          <h3 id="making-a-complaint">Making a complaint</h3>

          <p>You should first ask your pension provider for details of their complaints process. This process will be different depending on your provider and your type of pension.</p>

          <p>Follow their complaints process before taking more action.</p>

          <p>It’s best to make your complaint in writing (a letter or email) and to get a written response. This helps if you need to take your complaint further.</p>

          <p>If you’ve already followed your pension provider’s complaints process, there are different ways to take things further.</p>

          <h3 id="if-your-complaint-is-about-how-your-pension-has-been-run">If your complaint is about how your pension has been run</h3>

          <p>The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS) can give you free and independent advice if you have a complaint about how your pension has been run. For example, if your provider:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>has given you the wrong information</li>
            <li>has taken too long to do something</li>
          </ul>

          <p>TPAS can work with you and your pension provider to find a solution. However:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>it can’t make any legal decisions about whether your complaint is justified</li>
            <li>it can’t help you if you’ve already started legal action about your complaint</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If TPAS can’t resolve your complaint, you can contact the Pensions Ombudsman Service if your complaint is about how your pension has been run. This is a free and independent organisation. Like a court, it has legal powers to uphold or reject complaints.<a rel="external" href="https://www.pensions-ombudsman.org.uk/about-us/">Find out more about how the Pensions Ombudsman Service can help.</a></p>

          <h3 id="if-you-have-a-complaint-about-financial-advice">If you have a complaint about financial advice</h3>

          <p>The Financial Ombudsman Service can help if think you got the wrong financial advice that led you to take out the wrong pension. It can also help with other types of complaint about how a pension is sold or marketed.</p>

          <p>The Financial Ombudsman Service is free and independent. It has legal powers to uphold or reject complaints. <a rel="external" href="http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical_notes/pension-complaints-our-jurisdiction.html">Find out more about how the Financial Ombudsman Service can help.</a></p>

          <div class="application-notice info-notice">
            <p>Once an Ombudsman is dealing with your complaint, you won’t usually get more help with your complaint from another Ombudsman or organisation.</p>
