              If you’re unsure how much you’ve got in your whole pension pot, or
              how many pots you’ve paid into, there are different ways to find out.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>You can:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>contact your pension provider (the pension plan you paid into)
            </li>
            <li>look at your pension statement - your provider should have sent
              you this once a year
            </li>
            <li>look at your ‘wake-up pack’ - this is the pack you got from your
              pension provider between 4 and 6 months before your agreed
              retirement age (usually between 60 and 65)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you’re less than 4 months away from your retirement age and
            haven’t got a wake-up pack you should contact your pension provider.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may have paid into more than one pension pot. You’ll need to
            contact each pension provider to find out the value of each one.
