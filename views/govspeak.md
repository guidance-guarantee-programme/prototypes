Follow these steps to understand what your pension options are. They explain the most important things you need to know about your income in retirement.

^You can also download [your pension profile](/your-pension-profile.pdf) and fill it in on screen as you go through the steps. The profile will show you estimates of how much you might get from different options.

You can save the information you fill in - only you can see it. ^

##Before you start

You need to have a [defined contribution pension](/understand-your-pension-type#pension-types) for these steps to work. This is a pension based on how much has been paid into your pension pot.

Check with your provider if you’re not sure what type of pension you have.

##Your 6 pension steps

##1. Check how much you have in your pension pot

You can ask your pension provider to tell you how much is in your pension pot. You can also look at information your provider has sent to you already, eg a pension statement, or the ‘wake-up pack’ your provider sends 4 to 6 months before your agreed retirement age.

##2. Add up your other income

Work out the other income you’ll have in your retirement. This may include:

- the State Pension paid to you by the government - use the [State Pension calculator](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension) to get an estimate of how much you’ll get and when
- money from work, eg if you carry on working for some years
- benefits, eg pension credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit
- rental income
- interest from savings or pensioner bonds
- dividends from investments
- income from downsizing your property, eg if you sell and move into a smaller home

##3. Understand what you can do with your pension pot

You have several options. Don't make a rush decision.

- [do nothing](/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#do-nothing) - you can leave your pension pot untouched until you need the money
- [take your whole pot as cash](/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#take-your-whole-pot-as-cash) - 25% of this cash will be tax free
- take smaller sums of cash from your pot - each sum you take will be 25% tax free
- [buy a regular income for the rest of your life](/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#get-a-guaranteed-income-annuity) - known as an ‘annuity’
- [re-invest your pension pot and take money out when you need it](/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#take-money-out-when-you-need-it-income-drawdown) - known as ‘income drawdown’
- [mix these options](/what-you-can-do-with-your-pension-pot#mix-your-pension-options)

##4. Estimate your retirement costs
Consider costs that may arrive during your retirement, eg care and living costs, as well as other things like travel and leisure.

##5. Calculate your retirement income
To do this you need to add up income from your pension and elsewhere. Take away your regular costs. Think about how your income and costs will change in retirement.

[Calculate your retirement income](/calculating-your-retirement-income) and understanding [how long your money needs to last](/edge) can help you do this.

##6. Don't forget tax
Your income in retirement is taxed, just like it is when you’re in work. You have a tax-free Personal Allowance of £10,500. For everything above that you’ll pay Income Tax of 20%, 40% or 45%.

Once you’ve added up all your income you’ll need to take tax away.

[Tax you pay on your pension](/tax-you-pay-on-your-pension) can help you with this.
