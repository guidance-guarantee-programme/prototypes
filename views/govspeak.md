‘Pension scams’, in which criminals cheat people out of their pension pots, are increasing.

There are different types of pension scams. They often begin by someone contacting you unexpectedly about taking your pension money before you’re 55 or about the ways you can invest it. This type of unexpected contact is known as a cold call.

^You can only [take your pension money before you’re 55](www.gov.uk/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions) in rare cases, eg if you’re very ill.^

Scammers may offer you tempting ways to invest your pension pot, eg investing it in a new hotel being built in an exotic location.

Most of these offers are fake. Once you’ve transferred your money into a scam, it’s too late. You could lose all your pension money as well as face [tax of up to 55%](www.gov.uk/tax-on-pension/higher-tax-on-unauthorised-payments) or huge additional fees.

##How to tell if it’s a scam

Watch out if an individual or company:

* contacts you unexpectedly about your pension money through a phone call, a text message, visiting you in person, or in other ways
* says you can access your pension money before 55
* asks you to transfer your money quickly - never make a rush decision about your pension money
* uses words like ‘loan’, ‘loophole’, ‘free pension review’ or ‘one-off investment’
* offers you an investment described as ‘unique’, ‘overseas’, ‘environmentally friendly’, ‘ethical’ or in a ‘new’ industry
