##If youâ€™re divorced

The way a pension is split between you and your ex-partner is set out as part of the court settlement at the end of your marriage or civil partnership.

Pensions are split in three ways:

* your ex-partner is given a percentage share of one or more of your pension pots - this is known as [pension sharing](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-sharing)
* the value of a pension is offset against other assets, eg you keep all your pension money while your ex-partner keeps the home - this known as [pension offsetting](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-offsetting)
* once you start taking your pension money, your pension provider pays part of your payment to your ex-partner - this is known as [pension attachment or pension earmarking](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/when-relationships-end/pension-earmarking)

^Under pension attachment your ex-partner will need to wait until you start taking your pension before they can get their payments.^

^In Scotland, money that your ex-partner gets from pension attachment can only be from your tax-free lump sum, not from the rest of your pension.^

##The State Pension

Like a private pension, the [State Pension](/state-pension) paid to you by the government is legally treated as a financial asset that could end up split once a marriage or civil partnership ends.

If your marriage or civil partnership has ended, the court can order your ex-partner to share their State Pension with you. However, if you remarry or have another civil partnership you lose this right.

The National Insurance contributions paid by your ex-partner before your marriage or civil partnership ended can boost the State Pension that you get.

A [new State Pension](/new-state-pension) from 6 April 2016 may affect how much pension you get after the end of your marriage or civil partnership.
