#Introducing the Guidance Guarantee


##New pensions rules

From April 2015, new pension rules will apply. You’ll soon be able to take money
from your pension pot however you wish. This is your chance to make a decision
about how you want to receive your money in retirement.

##The Guidance Guarantee service

The government is creating a new service to help people understand what they can do with their pension pots when they retire. The service is free and will provide information on what your choices are and how they work.

You’ll have the option of speaking to an experienced pensions expert who will give you guidance about how to best use the money in your pension pot. You’ll be able to have this guidance session over the phone or face to face. Sessions are free, our experts won’t recommend any companies and any guidance you get is impartial.

The service will tell you about:

* The different pension types and how they work
* What you can do with your pension pot
* What’s tax-free and what’s not

##In development

This service is currently in development. During this phase we will be testing
the service with real users and making further improvements. Check back soon to
keep up to date with our progress.
