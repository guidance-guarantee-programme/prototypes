##1. Overview

Whatever you decide to do with your pension pot, you don’t have to stay with your current pension provider.

For example, one way to use your pension pot is to buy a guaranteed income for the rest of your life (an annuity). You don’t have to buy one from your current provider. Moving your pension pot to another provider could give you access to a wider range of annuities and a higher income.

The pack your provider sends you when you reach retirement age is likely to include information about their own products only. Research shows that 8 out of 10 people would have benefited from switching providers. You can choose to shop around by yourself or get paid-for help from a [financial adviser](/getting-financial-advice/4).


## 2. Comparing annuities - checklist

Before you shop around ask your current provider if they offer a [guaranteed annuity rate](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/retirement-choices/buying-an-annuity-how-to-shop-around/guaranteed-annuity-rates) - a fixed rate which was set when you started your pension.

Many pensions sold before 1990 offered these rates which may offer better value than annuities available elsewhere.

You should also check whether your current provider charges any penalties for moving to a different provider. This could affect how much money you get from your pension pot.

There are many different kinds of annuity and rates vary between providers. For example, if you have a health condition that affects your life expectancy, you may get more from an ‘enhanced’ annuity.

You should always compare annuities before making a final decision - once you’ve bought one you normally can’t change your mind after the 30 day cooling-off period.

###Comparing annuities - checklist

To compare annuities, you generally need to have the following information ready:

* the value of your pension pot
* the age you plan to retire
* your postcode
* the type of annuity you want (eg, one that will continue to pay your partner after your death)
* your health details (eg, some annuities pay more if you smoke or have a medical condition)

You can understand more about the different kinds of annuity and compare annuity rates on the [Money Advice Service website](https://annuities.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/xml/annuitiesMAS/an_form.cfm) or speak to a financial adviser to help you compare or discuss products you’ve found.


## 3. Comparing income drawdown products

To compare products where you take money from your pension pot as and when you need it (income drawdown) you’ll need some knowledge of investing. This means knowing which funds and markets to invest in to make sure your money keeps up with or beats the rate of inflation.

You’ll also need to look out for fees. Getting help from a financial adviser with help you with this.

###Comparing income drawdown - checklist

To compare income drawdown products, you’ll need to:

* understand investment terms and choices
* look at the options available on each product
* make decisions about where you want to invest your money
* check investment management and administration fees

You’ll also need to know how your [pension pot will be taxed](/tax-on-your-pension/1) every time your take money out of it.

%If your investments don't perform well and you take too much money from your pot, you could run out of retirement income.%

Getting an income drawdown product may involve transferring your pot to a different provider. If you're not confident with investing it may not be right for you. You should consider speaking to a financial adviser before getting an income drawdown product.


## 4. Getting financial advice

You may wish to speak to a financial adviser to help you compare retirement income products.

The more information you have prepared when you meet with one, the more you will benefit. This includes information about the value of your pension pot and other income.

Make sure your adviser is registered and approved by the FCA before you pay for advice. You can check the [FCA register](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do) to make sure they are.

###What a financial adviser will do

An adviser will ask about your current financial position, your goals and how you feel about taking risks with your money. This will help them to recommend retirement income products that are right for you now and in the future.

This list from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) explains what [an adviser might ask you](http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/financial-services-products/investments/financial-advice/what-an-adviser-might-ask-you).

You should always ask an adviser if they’re independent or restricted. Restricted advisers are limited to certain products (eg only annuities), providers or both. Independent advisers cover the whole market and are not restricted to one product type or provider.

###Paying for financial advice
Getting financial advice costs money and the fees vary. You need to know what fees and charges you’ll pay for advice and when you’ll be expected to pay.
You’ll pay a one-off fee if you see the adviser once, or a regular fee if the advice is ongoing. You can start by finding out if there is a fee for an initial consultation. Many offer this for free.
